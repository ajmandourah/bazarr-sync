var syncCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "sync",
	Short: "Sync subtitles to the audio track of the media",
	Example: "bazarr-sync --config config.yaml sync movies --no-framerate-fix",
	Long: `By default, Bazarr will try to sync the sub to the audio track:0 of the media. 
This can fail due to many reasons mainly due to failure of bazarr to extract audio info. This is unfortunatly out of my hands.
The script by default will try to not use the golden section search method and will try to fix framerate issues. This can be changed using the flags.`,
